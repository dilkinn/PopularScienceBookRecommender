0,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"What the author was going on about and what I particularly liked here is that there is nothing simple about human mind. A verifiable psychopath can have a bunch of traits that anyone can have (probably not all at the same time, still, a bunch of those). A healthy person can have exactly same things.For example, if you meditate, theta waves will be more often appearing on your EEG. Psychopaths (according to this researcher) have theta waves more often as well. Does meditation make you psychopathic? I doubt it. Another interesting tidbit to consider: we can't diagnose psychopathy reliably. We can't even diagnose depression or bipolar or OCD or ADHD or pretty much anything else reliably. Fore more on this one can refer to the Rosenhan experiment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenha.... Yes, it's old. Have things gotten better? Why should they have? I don't think so. We just won't see any today's experiments of this eloquence: the medical industry is not going to let such things happen, anymore. The industry is lucrative and foolproof (try proving you aren't insane, ADHD, depressive, etc... ). Spoiler: you can't prove a negative. And to prove a positive you just have to check a bunch of inane questions, like: have you been feeling restless? do you often feel distracted? Even the way such questionnaires are built can affect our responses (positive/negative questions, the order of questions, priming... ), so if you are to be considered ill, you will be, whatever you do.For one thing, it's dreadfully easy to go about our respective lives sticking labels at people: - You are feeling restless? ADHD is your problem, have some prescription drugs and be gone! You'll be stoned but you won't be distracted...- You want to be a surgeon/spy/policeman/priest? Psychopath, that's what you are - here are some handcuffs and obligatory therapy (and a surgery, maybe?) and a ban from some jobs and... whatever our society comes up with next...We have somehow gotten prone to villainizing or glorifying conditions. Bipolar becomes a trademark of creativity, psychopathy of evilness... It's no good, since there is no absolute normality. Everyone is abnormal in some way and medicating everyone into uniformity is not the best way to go about building a healthy society.Q:Theta waves are associated with drowsy, meditative, or sleeping states. Yet in psychopaths, they occur during normal waking states, even sometimes during states of increased arousal. (c)Q:Traits that are common among psychopathic serial killers, Kouri observes—a grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others—are also shared by politicians and world leaders: individuals running not from the police, but for office. Such a profile... allows those who present with it to do what they like when they like, completely unfazed by the social, moral, or legal consequences of their actions. (c)Q:Psychopathy is like sunlight. Overexposure can hasten one’s demise in grotesque, carcinogenic fashion. But regulated exposure at controlled and optimal levels can have a significant positive impact on well-being and quality of life. (c)Q:I think the problem is that people spend so much time worrying about what might happen, what might go wrong, that they completely lose sight of the present. They completely overlook the fact that, actually, right now, everything's fine. You can see that quite clearly in your interrogation exercise. What was it that chap told you? It's not the violence that breaks you. It's the threat of it. So why not just stay in the moment? (c)Q:I realised from quite early on in my childhood that I saw things differently from other people,' he wrote. 'But, more than not, it's helped me in my life. Psychopathy(if that's what you call it) is like a medicine for modern times. If you take it in moderation it can prove extremely beneficial. It can alleviate a lot of existential ailments that we would otherwise fall victim to because our fragile psychological immune systems just aren't up to the job of protecting us. But if you take too much of it, if you overdose on it, then there can, as is the case with all medicines, be some rather unpleasant side effects. (с)Q:These eight independent satellite states of the psychopathic personality--Machiavellian Egocentricity, Impulsive Nonconformity, Blame Externalization, Carefree Nonplanfulness, Fearlessness, Social Potency, Stress Immunity, and Coldheartedness. (c)Q:... Psychopaths are shadowmancers', the agent tells me, a large-scale map of the US dotted with timelines, hotspots and murderous crimson trajectories plastered across the wall behind his desk. 'They survive by moving around. They don't have the same need for close relationships that normal people do. So they live in an orbit of perpetual drift, in which the chances of running into their victims again is minimised. (c)Q:Because of these exaggerated dopamine responses, once they focus on the chance to get a reward, psychopaths are unable to alter their attention until they get what they're after. (c)Q:The results were extraordinary. Over 70 percent of those who scored high on the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale correctly picked out the handkerchief-smuggling associate, compared to just 30 percent of the low scorers. Zeroing in on weakness may well be part of a serial killer’s toolkit. But it may also come in handy at the airport. (c)"
1,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1297258-e,3,"So, this was disappointing.In sum, this book is about how some psychopathic qualities are actually really helpful and positive and incorporating them into your life can make you succeed. They can reduce anxiety and depression, make you more productive, and even make your more empathetic (although if you're a true psychopath with sadistic tendencies, the empathy payout is getting to enjoy the suffering of your victims more ... so, this isn't a heartwarming ""hope for psychopaths"" book).Look, I'll be honest. I was kind of jealous of psychopaths after reading this book. I mean, I'd love to react to all situations in a cold and calculating manner, with a accompanying drop in blood pressure and heartrate. I'd love to be able to never take things personally, see projects through doggedly to the end, and keep myself from fearing by staying strictly in the ""now."" (And as far as getting that message across, it was more effective in this medium for me than those crunchy feely Eckhert Tolle books). I was actually approaching this book as a kind of self-help manual, because lawyers are really high on the psychopath list and if you can't beat them, join them. (Well, only for working hours, that is.)What annoyed me is after all the promising studies, Dutton doesn't really tell us HOW to make the more positive traits of the psychopath into our own. While I understand part of the premise is that they're jsut ""wired that way"" (the author himself has part of his brain treated to feel like a psychopath for an afternoon). What I would've liked is something in the cognitive behavioral realm to get there. (There was also a mention of the dopamine-inhancing properties of amphetamines so I guess if all else fails ...) Instead, he wasted pages boycrushing on Special Forces agents, cops, and his childhood psychopathic friend who I'm unclear why he kept. Nope, he punted that to TIBETAN MONKS MEDITATING. Look, Tibetan monks have been doing that for a while. How about something more approachable?At the very least, it would've been considerate of him to include the questionnaire used to measure the index of one's own psychopathic tendencies, even if I was just a little morbidly curious after discovering I have not issues whatsoever shoving fat guys in front of streetcars to save other people. Since most of the studies use this as a basis to pick their subjects and control group, it would've been helpful.That said, I still learned enough from this book not to make it a tossup, but in the realm of essays on weird psychological phenomenon and its relevance, this had nothing on other books and lacked a real tongue-in-cheek (his OWN tongue, mind you) feel that probably would've made it roll a bit better. Instead, I felt like the author got too absorbed in exhibiting his comfort level around those tough manly manly psychopaths. The lack of female psychopaths in this book was also a real problem, even though he did point out they are the minority a contrast would've been nice since I think dealing with psychopathic females always has its own issues. In fact, given that he was targeting the ""most successful psychopaths"" and singing their praises to high heaven, some rep of the fairer sex would've been much appreciated. I mean, we're allowed to be lawyers now - even CEOs, the number ONE profession where you have a tendency to be a psychopath.Stil, a quick read to break in my new Kindle. Not bad if you want to learn that a psychological label doesn't turn you into Hannibal Lecter, not so great when you'd prefer to learn how to serve the other side its own kidneys at trial. "
2,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,0,"Mostly, this book was too technical for my personal reading-taste....but I think I got the basic point: WE ARE ALL A LITTLE BIT CRAZY! Everyone can be a psychopath: Business leaders, CEO's, sales people, traders, athletes, soldiers, TV & Radio workers, journalists, lawyers, surgeons, etc. Also---its more nature than a nurture thing.The author spends a good time in this book talking about 'Functional Psychopaths' --(in other words not all psychopaths are damaging to society). I couldn't help but wonder....""Yeah, but did the author spend times with their families""? How were those 'families' functioning? I wasn't sure what to make of the Quizes in this book....(self analysis) --The purpose of the quizzes was to have readers see (once again) that we all have psychopath tendencies. ----[""Functional""] Some basic characteristics of these psychopaths are: They may be charming, have an acute ability to read emotions in other people without being moved themselves, ruthlessness, intense capacity to focus, confident, mental resilience, antisocial traits, persuasiveness, lack of empathy, superficial charm, egocentricity, etc. One little detail I did find interesting (was the difference between the inner physical chemistry of a psychopath and a person who is not). For example: In times of stress, most people's heart rate goes UP ---but in a psychopath it drops. The BIG QUESTION I'm left with --(which still did NOT really get answered for me is -- ""WHERE"" is the 'WISDOM"" in the psychopath? I have a hard time putting those two words in the SAME sentence myself! NOTE: My local book club will discuss this book together next week ---(I'm sure I'll come away with feeling a little more 'enlighten' with the support of our group talk) "
3,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13080935-simon-fay,1,"In so far as dishing out some interesting facts on psychopathy this was a decent read. I'm all for learning the on/off switches that control what we define as our personalities and the book delivers on that front.In terms of pointing out worthwhile lessons to be taken from the personality disorder it was oddly biased (the author claims his father and best friend are psychopaths) and even more muddled. It makes a case that there are some instances where having a 'me me me' philosophy is beneficial to yourself (duh) but makes absolutely no coherent case for how it's beneficial for society as a whole. It's an instruction manual on how to come out on top when the ship is sinking, rather than a book on how to fix the damn hole in the boat.The author uses the game of 'chicken' to illustrate a possible instance where being a psychopath is a good thing, that the man who keeps his foot down on the pedal wins over the man who swerves out of the way. In terms of stats, I'm sure this plays out often enough for it to be a fun thought. In terms of applying it to international politics, I think one Cuban missile crisis is enough for the next millennium. Thanks anyway. I think I'd like some dudes in charge who don't get us into that game in the first place.It's rare that I'm bothered to write a review and having done so now I'm second guessing myself - maybe the book was pure satire? A Ferenghi's guide to surviving humanity? In any case, I doubt many readers would take it that way."
4,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8112718-kare-anderson,5,"Ironically, both psychopaths and Tibetan monks detect deep emotions that are invisible to others. Psychopaths are much better at recognizing “those telltale signs in the gait of traumatized assault victims” notes The Wisdom of Psychopaths author, Kevin Dutton. Tibetan monks, steeped in meditative practice, are also especially adept at reading feelings that are hidden from the rest of us, Paul Ekman discovered. Ekman, is the preeminent expert on lying and on the six universally expressed emotions in the face — anger, sadness, happiness, fear, disgust and surprise. Scarily, psychopaths score especially high on the Hare Self-Report Scale of psychopathy in seeing those core expressions, especially the ones that make us most vulnerable, fear and sadness, according to Sabrina Demetrioff.Another astounding finding was that, in lab tests, a Tibetan monk had no startle reflex reaction to “a gun being fired just centimeters away from the ear: the maximal threshold of human acoustical tolerance,” reports Dutton - yet others despite that finding. Ekman, and his co-researchers, Robert Levenson and Richard Davidson, concluded, according to Dutton, that “practicing a relaxed state of mind” is conducive to “keeping a cool head at one time or another.” Yet it appears that psychopaths don’t need that meditative practice to stay calm under pressure and or to be inordinately observant, especially of weaknesses in others. Psychopaths feel little or none of the arousal reactions (heart beat, sweat, blood pressure, etc.) that others have when viewing “a series of horrific, nauseating and erotic images,” found Dutton. Like the monks, psychopaths have greater self-mastery of their emotions. Unlike the monks, however, they seem to be born with this capacity to not feel nor react.That may not be the most surprising conclusion from Dutton’s book however.Unlike our common impression of psychopaths as dangerous serial killers, and some are, others use their high-performing capacity to remain calm in stressful times to conduct surgery, lead soldiers or become sought-after CEOs. After all, as Dutton suggests, if you’re having brain surgery, wouldn’t you want someone who is not distracted by feelings and completely in control and concentrating on the operation? If your life were in danger on the battlefield, wouldn’t you want someone who could coolly survey the situation and deeply recognize others’ reactions, to determine the best way to rescue you? Psychopaths adept detection of vulnerability is one of their most potent skills. See more at http://www.forbes.com/sites/kareander..."
5,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4262996-kate-woods-walker,1,"Psychopaths are not misunderstood geniuses with much to teach us about how to be human, as the author contends. They are murderers, rapists, child molesters and criminals of every stripe. They are Wall Street cheats and ruthless dictators. They are cult leaders, con men and reprobates.I agree with the esteemed Martha Stout about this book. Here's what she had to say in The New Republic: http://www.newrepublic.com/book/revie....Dutton seeks to normalize the horrors of the psychopathic personality, by selectively presenting the research of others, surrounded by souped-up prose. He should be ashamed of himself, but I suspect that's an impossibility."
6,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14966031-breakingviews,3,"By Martin LangfieldIf you’ve ever thought your boss is a psychopath, you may be right, according to psychologist Kevin Dutton. And if you’re a top-flight markets trader, captain of industry, surgeon or soldier, you may well be one yourself. But that’s OK, says Dutton. It may even be optimal. “The Wisdom of Psychopaths,” an exploration of serial killers, monks, spies and CEOs through the prism of personality tests and neuroscience, is a good book lurking within a bad one. In this regard it perfectly reflects its theme, which is that among the dark traits which make a person psychopathic nestle behaviors and abilities that are not only necessary, but good, for individuals and society. In the seeds of evil, he proposes, wisdom may be found. An Oxford University research psychologist, Dutton may discomfit many readers with an almost adolescent joy in mixed metaphors and grating puns, relishing the shock value of his premise as he liberally applies the term “psychopath” to all kinds of people. It may sound like he is suggesting sadistic ax-murderers or serial rapists lurk within all men, but his point is rather more subtle. Perhaps this approach is a deliberate attempt to open the reader’s mind to new ideas. Or perhaps he needs a more restrained editor. Still, a razor-sharp intellect with a serious academic purpose lurks behind the loose phrasing and wordiness. Dutton stacks up references to interlocking personality studies, brain scans and physiological examinations, comparing members of the general population with those behind bars and those who excel at certain sharp-end professions. His argument is that most “psychopaths” aren’t violent, and indeed most aren’t locked away. Many excel in society precisely because they possess, in a more moderate or controlled way, the same traits that land their more antisocial brethren in a world of hurt. The key traits include: ruthlessness; intense capacity to focus, excluding all distractions such as fear; powerful reward motivation; a disposition to action; acute ability to read emotions in other people, without being moved by them; charisma; mental resilience; and mindfulness, the ability to live in the present moment. Many people have some of these traits, he says. Those who can manage to flick them on and off according to circumstance have a powerful toolkit for doing well in life, particularly in high-risk, high-reward professions. Those with only partial control of such traits, or who have them jammed full-on all the time, may severely hurt others, ruin their own business or even damage the world economy. Those who lack any such traits should try to embrace a few, Dutton suggests. In examining CEOs, Dutton also cites a 2005 academic study that compared business managers, psychiatric patients and hospitalized criminals in a psychological profiling test. “A number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals,” Dutton writes, listing attributes such as superficial charm, egocentricity, persuasiveness, lack of empathy, independence, and focus. The main difference lay in the “antisocial” traits, with the criminals’ physical aggression, impulsivity and lawbreaking dials cranked up higher. One of Dutton’s own surveys, in which visitors to his website take a personality test called the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and give details of their professions, found that CEOs ranked highest on the scale, followed by lawyers, TV and radio workers, salespeople, surgeons and journalists. Dutton interviews “functional psychopath” special-forces soldiers, financial traders, lawyers and doctors, often in exotic locales, who speak of experiencing altered states of consciousness when entirely focused on their work, akin to the concept of “flow” or “optimal experience” of Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. One of the most intriguing of Dutton’s insights is the similarity he relates between certain psychopathic traits and those exhibited by experts in Buddhist meditation. Both are very good, for example, at reading emotions in people’s faces, embracing new experiences, remaining in the moment and practicing detachment. To say psychological traits required in killing and in making a killing in the markets are not dissimilar may seem trite. Yet Dutton, despite his tendency to showboat, uses that observation as a starting point for a disconcerting and intelligent exploration of the outer reaches and useful inner depths of at least some human minds."
7,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/707579-marija-s,3,"I guess I expected too much from this one.It is not so much that it left me unconvinced, but I still have trouble with discerning what Dutton's hypothesis was in the first place. The book appears to be a mumbo jumbo of anecdotes, scientific article and book excerpts, snaps from interviews, lectures, conversations. It is easy to read and has insightful points which remain just that - points of reference for further exploration - but I often failed to grasp the meaning the author was trying to underline by them. I have encountered the term 'psychopath' while studying criminal and related laws, and it did help a lot as a background for this book, because the author left out some pretty important things like statistics (e.g. gender distribution), how do psychopaths function when they're not breaking moral/legal norms (relationships, friendships, offspring care,..), how to test yourself to see where you are on the scale, etc.. but for example got into explaining some relatively uninteresting and tedious interpretations of traits in psychology testing. Also, to jump from theme to theme without reaching any conclusion or drawing a line, just to be brought back to the same topic only with an additional example, is a repetitive and tiring practice of this author. The biggest minus of this book (apart that it is popular science, with a big emphasis on 'popular') is that it painfully lacks structure and a clear way of presenting a thesis. Sometimes, while reading, I was under the impression that the interviewees should be the ones writing a book (which most of them, accidentally, did) and that this book is just some guy stealing crumbs off tables of experts, investigators, real life psychopaths, etc. and not doing a top notch job out of it either.In short, psychopaths are not 'wise', they are simply differently hard-wired.At least this book cleared out for me why I disliked politicians and lawyers. And James Bond. "
8,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275281-william,4,"The Wisdom of Psychopaths begins with a few strikes against it. First, one suspects the publisher commissioned it as a knockoff of Jon Ronson's The Psychopath Test, published a year earlier. Second, it's vaguely framed as a self-help book, although it never really commits to the concept.Regardless of the publisher's intention, Kevin Dutton turns out to hold the better credentials—he's a research psychologist at Oxford University—and acquits himself well as a nonfiction author. (He can be forgiven for not being quite as fun as Ronson; few are). Already familiar with the real-life test of Ronson's title, although I have not read his take on the subject, I gave in to the ""wisdom"" hook and plowed ahead.The Wisdom of Psychopaths moves as quickly and entertainingly as any survey of research and literature can, not just of psychopathy—which to me is inherently fascinating—but theories of personality in general, and the experiments behind them. I later read that Ronson had been criticized for taking some liberties with the research; in this way, if Dutton's book was at all intended a follow-on, it seems less a me-too entry and more like a corrective by someone from the field.Dutton also makes a persuasive enough case that certain character traits associated with psychopathy—charm, focus, and fearlessness, among others—can be advantageous, if one can keep it in check. For anyone who wants to get ahead (unsurprisingly, in business especially) it can help to become something of a ""method psychopath"". Alas, Dutton doesn't spend much time with that, but if he writes that as a follow-up, I'll be there."
9,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877807-persephone,3,"Last autumn, I came across this article in the Globe and Mail which includes an interview with author Kevin Dutton and an overview of his book The Wisdom of Psychopaths. I felt a dropping in my stomach as I read it, because at the end of the article were two lists: one denoting leadership traits, the other the corresponding psychopathic traits. The first list came fairly close to describing my father. The second list pretty much nailed him. I sat in a mild state of shock for a few minutes, then logged into my local library's web site and put a hold on the book.Dr Kevin Dutton begins The Wisdom of Psychopaths with tales of his own father and his father's audacity. Neither Dutton's dad nor mine was a serial killer (so far as I know). This is the point. We use the term ""psychopath"" as a synonym for ""serial killer"". This isn't so, and Dutton is by no means the first person to make this point. Most of us probably personally know people living with autism, Parkinson's Disease or schizophrenia. (I certainly do.) Why wouldn't we also know functional psychopaths?Dutton describes how the very qualities that help politicians, surgeons, military intelligence operatives, CEOs and sales people rise in their professions and succeed in what they need to do are similar to the traits shared by some of the most dangerous people in our society. He calls these ""The Seven Deadly Wins"": ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness (as in living in the here and now), and action (""Psychopaths,"" Dutton declares, ""never procrastinate."").As I read, I thought of the possible psychopaths I'd encountered in my own life: a boy at school who could turn friendliness on and off when it suited him, a teaching partner whose relationships with the students we shared made me uneasy, at least two of the Resident Fan Boy's bosses, and yes, my own charming, reckless, and heartless father.I admit, though, I'm nothing but an armchair psychologist and this book, written in a glib, popular-science style, is nothing more than food for thought. An interesting read, but not something on which to base your life philosophy. Unless, like a psychopath, you have little in the way of a conscience."
10,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17208123-marta,2,"This rating has a lot to do with my expectations, but also with the fact that I don't agree with the author's view. I'm a psychology student and like many people I'm interested in psychopaths and how their minds work. My roommate got this book from one of her friends and because she gave up on it, I ended up reading it to see how it is. So, I went almost blindly in this one, not knowing what to expect. From the title and the synopsis, I was expecting stories about popular psychopaths, like Ted Bunty and so on. This book is more general than that, it presents some theories, some studies about psychopaths, about how some of them are functional (actually have important functions in our world). They are businessmen, politicians, lawyers and judges and the author wonders if we should learn something from psychopaths, if we should learn to be focused on the present, to have a cold empathy (focused on perception) rather than a warm one (focused on feelings).  Then he started with all this debate about how we are all turning into psychopaths because of social media and so on. Let's agree to disagree. I'm tired of hearing all these stupid remarks about my generation being full of narcissists, I feel like we're rather the most insecure generation out there because of social media.  I think some of his theories were interesting, but he went a little too far. While it's important to make people aware that some psychopaths are among us and not all of them are criminals and so on, I'm not sure it will be beneficial for our society if all of us turned into 'functional psychopaths'."
11,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17287039-mrnica,1,"The author is ""that guy"". He has some vague attempts at being self deprecating but just can't hide how much he wants to make love to himself--not in the normal masturbatory way, but in a creepy doppelganger gangbang sort of way.Also, the book reads like an excessively long blog post.The article on this book from Scientific American Mind covers anything you might want to learn without the nausea and the bitter taste of haterade."
12,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This is a really unique take on a perhaps taboo subject matter. I though that his information was well presented, interesting, and definitely took a more broad view of the mind and psychosis. Its an enjoyable read and I really enjoyed how he took others views in account such as Steven Pinkers thoughts on violence in society. I would read this again. "
13,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,4,"Actually this is even better than I anticipated, in that the author directly argues his point with some decent supporting evidence. Other books that are trying to make an interesting point (e.g. Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking) often don't really go anywhere other than trying to blow your mind with neat and quirky things that studies have found. And what is the author's point? That psychopaths are useful in some areas of society, and that people can do better at some things if they have psychopathic tendencies. He talks a lot more about the Serial Killers and Spies, but he does tie in Saints towards the end.There's a lot of good stuff to learn in here about the current state of psychopath research, including that there are (interview) tests that are pretty good at differentiating psychopaths from regular people, although the DSM IV doesn't differentiate psychopathy from ASD (the author makes a good argument for doing so). Dutton keeps returning to the issue of whether psychopaths feel empathy, where it seems they can under conditions that don't bring out their psychopathic behavior, and in fact they are apparently much better at reading emotional states than regular people.There were a couple of things I wish were elucidated a bit more in book, where they are just kind of dropped like curiosity bombs: that psychopaths don't have the normal ""alert"" brain wave that EEGs read from people (beta waves), and instead have theta waves which normal people have when drowsy or in deep meditation. Also, there's a statement that psychopaths don't procrastinate, which if it's true would be a very good self-indicator. However, there's not much to back up that claim."
14,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5865312-long-nguyen,5,"Written at a very accessible level for a casual reader of psychology, packed with moments of humor and active thinking, and ultimately an enjoyable read. It makes one wonder where on the sliding scale we'd be, or at least I did. The contrast between saints and sinners gets a little blurry as Dutton tries to make the case that in moderate doses, some psychopathic traits are very beneficial to society. I wonder then, if it's at all possible to prevent the negatives while capitalizing on the positives. Of course, this is a bit greedy, to want the cake and eat it too. But the alternative is to not have these traits floating about at all, and that doesn't seem beneficial either (nor is it possible, given reality). An undercurrent topic also surfaces occasionally, the interaction between what is a natural talent and what can be acquired. The author does not seem to address it directly though. The reader is left to judge and go from there, not that it's a bad thing to think on the evidence by one's self."
15,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"If you choose to read this book, I would advise regarding it completely as entertainment. Don’t expect it to reveal too much about the issue of psychopathy—it tells the reader much more about the author than about this mental condition.This is a book to be enjoyed for its anecdotes, not for its scholarship. The author seems to believe that quite a number of psychopaths populate his life—from his father to one of his childhood friends. Plus he tells an entertaining story of his visit to Broadmoor Hospital, where psychopaths are securely housed.Despite the author’s enthusiasm, I’m not sure that we regular folk have anything of any great import to learn from psychopaths. Much more significant in my opinion is the ability of regular folk to recognize these damaged people and deal with or avoid them, something that the author doesn’t even broach. This seems to be more the author as a fan, rather than a realist. Despite this, an entertaining read."
16,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5175325-sumeet-mahendra,4,"Though I've read this book quite fast but I really enjoyed those useful lessons and somehow in mid of it, I started considering myself as a good psychopath. Someone who has total control on fear or any emotion, whatsoever. And, it maybe due to years of mediation & reading spiritual scriptures. The main message in this book is:Some psychopaths end up in jail as tried murderers and rapists, but others are successful executives, lawyers and surgeons and hold high political offices.

Dr. Dutton examines the phenomenon of the psychopathic personality from every angle, positive and negative, and makes the resulting study lively, fascinating, and serious but also often funny. He explores the latest science at the time of writing (2009) seeking explanations of how and why some people are psychopaths, how they think and behave, and even undergoes an experimental procedure with a trancranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) machine - one I'd love to try too - to have his own brain very temporarily rendered psychopathic, so he can experience and report first-hand on what it's like to live inside such a mind.He also looks at the presence, sometimes merely useful and sometimes absolutely essential, of some but not all of the traits of a psychopath in the people who are the very best in a number of professions and ways of life ranging from politicians and lawyers through law enforcement and special forces personnel to advanced Buddhist monks (something that was unsettling to a Buddhist friend and meditation instructor when I told her about it.) He also examines the question of whether our culture as a whole is becoming more psychopathic (it seems that it is), why, and what implications that has for the future.Definitely a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, crime and the law, brain science, and trends in Western society."
18,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12626843-edward-hoornaert,5,"This fascinating book made me think and reevaluate, which is as high a compliment as I can pay. I was originally drawn to it by an interview with the author in the Toronto Globe and Mail. Dr. Dutton said that not all psychopaths are dangerous (which I already knew; many of them were bank traders who drove us to the Great Recession), but he took it further: he stated that in some circumstances, being a psychopath is an advantage. Many psychopaths are extremely successful, as is shown by a study that determined the U.K.'s professions with the greatest percentage of psychopaths: 
   CEO 
   Lawyer 
   Media (TV/Radio) 
   Salesperson 
   Surgeon 
   Journalist 
   Police Officer 
 I realized also that Dutton's description of psychopaths fit the stereotypical hero of romance novels! Reading this book reinforced that thought ... though it also made me pity any woman who thinks that she will be the one who can induce a ruthless, goal oriented, low-empathy psychopath to become all warm and cuddly!All in all, a thought-provoking read."
19,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4308405-sweepea888,5,"Sutton's interest in the subject is somewhat personal; he suspected his own father was a 'path!A few small anecdotes in and he gets to the meat: he interviews a few experts in the field to get their perspective on if, how the traits of a psychopath can actually be.... beneficial if we utilize them in our daily lives. Unlike sociopaths (emotional, prone to outbursts of uncontrolled anger, yadda) psychopaths are described as having emotions, just 'dialed way down'. In fact, contrary to what many people think they not only have empathy they are more than capable of feeling what others do hence their ability to um, spot potential prey and enjoy manipulating them. Dr. Dutton's voice throughout was enjoyable. He maintained a bit of humor and I particularly liked his talk with the esteemed Dr. Robert Hare. Hare created the psychopath checklist (now known as the PCL- R ; or 'revised') which is used by clinicians world wide to diagnose 'paths . He emailed Hare tentatively to 'meet for coffee' and Hare emailed back 'how about drinks in the hotel bar' HA! Scotch with BOB. Good stuff.Also a super interesting bit included Dutton meeting with Andy McNab, a decorated office for MI6 who was captured (and tortured) by Taliban . Mc Nab shared his thoughts on how he (a psychopath, yes, they had him tested with wires/monitors and such and he had zero reaction to deeply upsetting images, etc) thinks and problem solves and how it is different from the average person.In terms of 'effectiveness' Dutton makes an interesting point: They are fearless, have zero concern for personal safety and are not emotionally volatile. These traits (in the right situation) are perfect for soldiers/law enforcement personnel. When your back is to the wall, according to Dutton, you actually *want* a psychopath in your corner as they make quick decisions and do not panic. Another section of the book explored the correlation between 'path behavioral traits and saints as well as monks. Yes, monks! One monk was able to mediate using 'active presence mediation' as he called it. Hooked up to monitors gauging his heart rate he was able to maintain absolute control over his physiological reactions while being subjected to an array of violent images. So, perhaps we can learn some of the 'tunnel vision' and self teach control without the other negative traits a psychopath has?And of course Dutton rounds it all out with a visit to the infamous Broadmoor hospital in England, home of the criminally insane. He met with some cherry picked 'paths and presented them with several hypothetical situations and their responses were incredibly subdued and well, for lack of better phrasing ingenious. His intent was this: they can think outside of the box, in fact they usually do when it comes to approaching a problem or task. Make no mistake; this book is not in defense of psychopaths. Rather it offers more angles on how to view these odd freaks of nature (because really, they're not the norm) and if you're interested in this topic you'll learn new things despite how many books you've read before.His writing is solid and I'll check out his first book as well. "
20,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,3,"Don't be fooled by the title. Although this book does take a look into how convicted and named ""psychopaths"" go about doing what they do, this is really a book about how to get what you want. Psychopaths just seem to not mind overstepping the boundary of the sanctity of human life. Runners up? Why, CEO's, of course. The breakdown covers traits of those who are successful at what they do. PK's are hyper-focused, usually charismatic, and don't let things like morality, being good or nice, get in the way of doing what they want. We all have these traits to a degree, but we all, for the most part, have a boundary which we do not cross. Part of that is avoiding retribution from the law, but for the majority it's about excelling in a field fairness, and justice, with a heavy reliance on real skills and ability. Unfortunately, those leaning towards ""psychopath"" tendencies have no problems pushing the envelope of lying, intimidating, and ultimately bodily harm to others.What's amazing to me is the managing trait of the psycho boss. They rule (lead?) via fear and acting irrational. Clearly, exhibiting these traits show that the manager is not qualified, has blustered their way into a position they shouldn't be, and in no way will offer any value other than motivating workers to look for another job. Yet, there they are. Perhaps even you have had the privilege to work for such a manager."
21,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,3,"What i can sum up from reading this book: Psychopaths possess certain personality traits which few of us have or master, this is advantageous in many circumstances in the complexity of life, and this may bring success in certain profession with proper containment of those traits. But the counterpoint is that some of the traits are not inherently psychopathic and we can practice them with examples not from psychopaths but those trustworthy, compassionate as well. If you want to better yourselves, go for the traits, do not take the thankless job of seeing psychopaths are prime models. The book is also repetitive at times and could have been more concise, to the point presentation of facts and findings. "

You’ll find them in any organization where your position and status afford you power and control over others, and the chance of material gain.”His coauthor on the corporate psychopathy paper, New York industrial and organizational psychologist Paul Babiak, agrees.“The psychopath has no difficulty dealing with the consequences of rapid change. In fact, he or she thrives on it,” he explains. “Organizational chaos provides both the necessary stimulation for psychopathic thrill seeking and sufficient cover for psychopathic manipulation and abusive behavior.”Ironically, the rule-bending, risk-taking, thrill-seeking individuals who were responsible for tipping the world economy over the edge are precisely the same personalities who will come to the fore in the wreckage. Just like Frank Abagnale, they are the mice who fall into the cream, fight and fight, and churn that cream into butter.***The word “psychopath” carries with it certain unavoidable connotations: images of famous serial killers, like Ted Bundy or Henry Lee Lucas and the almost mythic stories surrounding their individual reigns of terror; thoughts of men and women filled with uncontrollable, malevolent thoughts, in many cases acting on them to the harm and detriment of others. More and more, however, the term is finding application in more readily acceptable spheres—politics and the financial markets, to name a couple of quick and obvious examples, where making a killing, as nefarious as it sounds, is a far more benign proposition than its literal alternative. Even more interesting are the misnomers surrounding genuine psychopathy and what it truly means to be psychotic—and what such personality traits mean for the probability of success.In his new book, The Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success, University of Cambridge professor of social psychology Dr. Kevin Dutton deep dives the psychopathic mind in order to strip away some of the more notorious preconceptions that have dogged psychopaths for generations, and in the process to offer a better understanding of their particular, often feared psychologies. There’s an adaptive nature to psychopaths not accurately shown in most public portrayals. It isn’t rooted in amorality or malicious intent, but in an emotional fearlessness that, when balanced with an awareness of social expectations and/or knowledge or passion towards socially acceptable ventures or professions, gives psychopaths a noticeable leg-up. On the outside this can be represented by an unconventionally high degree of personal magnetism, or confidence, or the ability to disguise oneself—to play to the crowd, so to speak, no matter the attributes of said crowd; or maybe it reveals itself as uncanny business acumen, or willingness to go into battle regardless of whether or not the odds of survival are low. The point Dutton makes is that contrary to popular belief, there are uses—indeed necessities—for a mind more prone to stereotypically psychopathic traits, especially when presented with situations where emotional vulnerabilities are potentially grave liabilities.The portraits of psychopaths Dutton paints are not the Patrick Bateman/Hannibal Lecture-style geniuses whose penchant for murder is well hidden beneath their business and academic minds. Those certainly exist and should be feared; however, most cases of psychopathy can be presented, as strange as this might sound, as being of exquisitely analytical and sound mind:“Language, for psychopaths, is only word deep. There’s no emotional contouring behind it. A psychopath may say something like ‘I love you,’ but in reality, it means about as much to him as if he said ‘I’ll have a cup of coffee.’… This is one of the reasons why psychopaths remain so cool, calm, and collected under conditions of extreme danger, and why they are so reward-driven and take risks. Their brains, quite literally, are less ‘switched on’ than the rest of ours.”Because of this, a psychopathic mind (providing it does not sway too far to one extreme or the other) can be expertly employed in situations requiring planning or some sort of conflict resolution.So what can psychopaths teach us? That, for the most part, our problems—our fears and apprehensions that cripple us daily, or cause us to procrastinate and not live our lives to the potential we so desperately want to believe is inside each of us—are problems of the heart, and that it is how we are tuned to our emotions, and the degree to which they dominate our doubts, that exemplifies our collective weaknesses. Does this mean a balanced, socially integrated functional psychopath has an advantage over the average man, woman, and hopefully non-psychopathic child? It depends on the situation: when playing the stock market, most assuredly, as one cannot ever let one’s emotions be rattled by a loss—therein lies financial death and a quick shuttling to the side for this guy over here with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a willingness to take a beating one day and come back swinging hard the next; but when, say, teaching a class in an elementary or high school setting, not likely, as the inability to sync with individuals who are by and large emotional lightning rods could be potentially exhausting for all parties involved.A psychopath is not necessarily a killer, or a heartless machine capable of only taking advantage of others, as we’re so frequently instructed to believe (given the rampant overuse and abuse of the term). That stereotype exists for a reason, as it is sometimes accurate; but, as with all points on the psychological spectrum, there are an infinite number of shades of grey that can be used to better define psychopathy to individual standards. Dutton’s examination goes a fair distance in disproving the concreteness of the stereotype, while opening the conversation to new possibilities as to how we see our business and political leaders, and even our more successful surgeons, spies, and military personnel. These professions, and many others, cater to a certain degree of psychopathy, which can often be mistaken for simply luck or confidence, but is in fact a much more complicated matter, one contained within the physiology of a surprisingly large amount of the population."
24,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13820728-romina-claudia,3,"An interesting popscy read, although in my opinion it lacks a basic storyline. U read about a tibetan monk then about a truck driver, then about a soldier, then about a dinner with a specialist; the positive outcomes of being a psychopath are mixed with the negative ones, not following a specific logic. Or maybe I’ve just missed it. The accuracy of the information is debatable, as in most books of this type. The title is a click bite though. However, there are a lot of interesting information and it does give you something to reflect on. The amount of work the author put into the research is remarkable, as well as his passion for the subject. "
25,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75267716-owen-townend,3,"While I am fascinated by the mental make-up of the psychopath, I am no proponent of the idea that psychopaths are cooler than everyone else. Dutton labours under that assumption for a good portion of this book. This bias could be forgivable if it weren't for his writing style.The Wisdom of Psychopaths is an informative exploration of the topic but it is inconsistent. The book starts with some very dry passages focusing on neurological and psychological studies and their findings, only to then swap to a gonzo journalistic style which I will admit was infinitely more preferable. What is not to like about a chapter where Dutton meets with military thriller novelist Andy McNab to undergo a procedure testing for psychopathic reaction? Indeed I learned more about McNab in a matter of pages than I ever have from reading his writing. It was genuinely stimulating facts like this that stuck in my mind, certainly not variations of the Trolley Problem and how certain brains respond to it. Having read Jon Ronson's superior book The Psychopath Test, I'm afraid The Wisdom of Psychopaths doesn't quite measure up. It was much too easy to break away from reading this which feels wrong considering the subject matter. You expect a book about psychopathology to be all engrossing, you expect to only ever break away because turning the page has become too disconcerting. You don't expect to break away because you're bored.Nevertheless, stylistic disappointment aside, I did learn a lot about psychopaths and even came to appreciate how their single-minded purpose can bear positive results. I just feel I could have absorbed so much more had these facts been strung together with a more dependable voice. Regardless I recommend The Wisdom of Psychopaths to those with a passion for all things neurally atypical."
26,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57346995-lexy,5,I thought that this book was good 
27,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46002774-amber,0,"DNFI couldn’t get into it. I found it so boring despite the appealing premise. It was repetitive as well, and didn’t get to any tangible point. I won’t be finishing it. "
28,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10035473-john-cooper,1,"The author begins his book by explaining that his own father was a psychopath. On what evidence? It seems that while he was driven to succeed, he was undeterred by failure, and his spirits never sank. If this seems like unsupported reasoning to you, you may find the rest of the book irritating as well. The author consistently uses the two techniques illustrated by his introduction: label anyone who strongly exhibits any trait among the many associated with sociopathic personality disorder as a ""psychopath""; and burden every page with sensationalism until it groans. So the early sections of the book explain to us that many surgeons, who are masters of cold precision at the operating table, are psychopaths. Special Forces members, who love danger and seem fearless, are psychopaths. Anyone who succeeds at the difficult and often merciless decisions associated with growing a business is probably a psychopath.How much more interesting this book would have been if the author had identified himself as a psychopath. I don't know whether he is, although I suspect he could be fit into his own loose definition. Unfortunately, he chooses to present himself as one of the inferior majority, doomed to approaching life with all the usual fears and hesitations. The section where he visits Broadmoor Prison, where universally acknowledged psychopaths are housed, should have been one of the strongest parts of the book, providing a little insight into the mindsets of the most remorseless killers. Instead, the visit is milked for every drop of amateur dramatics, as he describes himself quaking with fear as he gazes into the predator's steely eyes, and so on ad nauseum. It's as clumsy and shallow as a high-schooler's field trip report.If you can wade through all the crap (the ability to do so being a psychopathic trait), there is value to be had here, particularly in the research studies cited, which you are of course free to Google and learn more about, if your curiosity hasn't been dampened by the predictable and repetitive claims that ""what they found was astounding."" The raw material that remains visible suggests what a good book about this subject might have been like. "
29,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19069281-tirath,5,"The brilliant thing about psychopaths is that they are quite rational, and sometimes, too rational.Fear is useless because it is based on potential outcomes, many of which may not happen and have definitely not happened in real life (right now).The brain goes into a fast forward mode - and you lose sight of the present.What if you were asleep? Then, you wouldn't be scared would you?Shouldn't one unknown life be less valuable than 4 unknown lives? If yes, then push.Psychopaths are amazing at understanding others, but not at empathising with them; disconnect between knowing what an emotion is and what it feels like.Is the larger, general society becoming more psychopathic, with its diregard for others - prevalent everywhere?What's the point of showing emotion when it's not going to make any difference?Best part (Pg 182):""What's worse, from a moral perspective? Beating someone up who deserves it? Or beating yourself up who doesn't?""Why do people tolerate ruthlessness in sport but not in everyday life? Whats the difference?The problem with a lot of people is that what they think is a virtue is actually a vice in disguise.People get too caught up in the heat of the moment, based on their perception of others perception of them - and temporarily go off track. Now, this makes people lose sight of what they want, and make 'winning' the goal.- Wonder how psychopathic behaviour shows itself between genders? Are men more prone to be psychopaths?- And the effect of culture and society - do close knit societies and communities spawn fewer psychopaths (Asia?)- Thought provoking book throughout"
30,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
31,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "
32,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687185-mari,2,"I was going to say this could have been so much better, but really, with the premise presented, I don't know that there was much to salvage. It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "

Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
34,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."

""...the emergence of neurolaw...the increasingly greater interest the courts are now taking in cutting edge neuroscience. The watershed study was published in 2002, and found that a functional polymorphism in a neurotransmitter metabolizing gene predicts psychopathic behavior in men who were mistreated as children.

36,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"
37,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"Interesting, technical and yet entertaining book that mainly focuses on the functional psychopath. What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies. It may be a bit technical for the average reader at times but definitely fascinating. (Also, permanent addition to my office bookshelf)4.39 / 5"

And, even then, I didn't think there was much. It wasn't blatantly stated, but something one more had to assume. They can teach us how to keep a cool head in tough situations, about taking rejection well, about putting everything in and not being afraid to lose it. I mean, those are good traits, and I agree with the statement that there are functional psychopaths rather than them all just turning out to be serial killers."

Things we didn’t learn how to do - leverage the decision making power of psychopaths to enhance our lives. The book title is a lie. Too many recaps on research studies. Interesting things I wish were discussed more - will society decide to weed out psychopaths with DNA testing and genome mapping? Will we use gene therapy to “fix” babies who show psychopathic tendencies? Can criminals claim their psychopathic genes made crime inevitable and receive lesser sentences?"

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read. Huge shout out to my friend Tommy for loaning me his copy of The Wisdom of Psychopaths!This review and more can be found at A Reader's Diary!"
45,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "
46,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2330510-tex,4,"I’m fascinated by the potential for psychopaths to have a place in society and the studies and examples Dutton puts forth confirm it. It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

51,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

55,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60373241-cristina-andrici,0,"Good ending and I respect his work.But..Considering the fact that this book is also designed for (or that is what I thought) non-specialized in Psychology/Neurology readers, it should include less specialized words in these fields. Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
56,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."
57,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13200679-dushyant-chaturvedi,4,"What psychological attributes make up a psychopath? Can we measure the degree of such attributes? Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
58,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
59,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
60,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
61,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "

It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "
63,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85949810-rosie-wedge,3,"3.5* rounded downOn the whole, this was an interesting read, and I enjoyed it a lot. Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
64,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."

""...the emergence of neurolaw...the increasingly greater interest the courts are now taking in cutting edge neuroscience. The watershed study was published in 2002, and found that a functional polymorphism in a neurotransmitter metabolizing gene predicts psychopathic behavior in men who were mistreated as children. The gene in question - terms, as mentioned previously, the ""warrior gene"" by the media - controls the production of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), low levels of which had previously been linked with aggressive behavior in mice.""""Boys who are abused or neglected, and who possess a variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, are at an increased risk as they get older of turning into violent psychopaths.""""In 2006, Bradley Waldroup's defense attorney, Wylie Richardson, summoned Professor William Bernet, a forensic psychiatrist from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to the witness stand. Waldroup stood accused of one of the must brutal and heinous crimes in Tennessee's history (he committed a murder and viciously assaulted his estranged wife)."" The defensive went on to argue that the defendent has the variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, and that he was violently beaten by his parents as a child. So who's responsible?"
66,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"

What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies. It may be a bit technical for the average reader at times but definitely fascinating. (Also, permanent addition to my office bookshelf)4.39 / 5"

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read.

75,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature.

81,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
86,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."

Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
88,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
89,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
90,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
91,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "
92,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687185-mari,2,"I was going to say this could have been so much better, but really, with the premise presented, I don't know that there was much to salvage. It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "
93,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85949810-rosie-wedge,3,"3.5* rounded downOn the whole, this was an interesting read, and I enjoyed it a lot. Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
94,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."
95,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11245511-bridgid,2,"A bit of a tough read at times, but interesting stuff.In ch. 5 ""Make me a psychopath"", the case of Bradley Waldroup. ""...the emergence of neurolaw...the increasingly greater interest the courts are now taking in cutting edge neuroscience. The watershed study was published in 2002, and found that a functional polymorphism in a neurotransmitter metabolizing gene predicts psychopathic behavior in men who were mistreated as children. The gene in question - terms, as mentioned previously, the ""warrior gene"" by the media - controls the production of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), low levels of which had previously been linked with aggressive behavior in mice.""""Boys who are abused or neglected, and who possess a variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, are at an increased risk as they get older of turning into violent psychopaths.""""In 2006, Bradley Waldroup's defense attorney, Wylie Richardson, summoned Professor William Bernet, a forensic psychiatrist from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to the witness stand. Waldroup stood accused of one of the must brutal and heinous crimes in Tennessee's history (he committed a murder and viciously assaulted his estranged wife)."" The defensive went on to argue that the defendent has the variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, and that he was violently beaten by his parents as a child. So who's responsible?"
96,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"
97,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"Interesting, technical and yet entertaining book that mainly focuses on the functional psychopath. What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies. It may be a bit technical for the average reader at times but definitely fascinating. (Also, permanent addition to my office bookshelf)4.39 / 5"

Interesting things I wish were discussed more - will society decide to weed out psychopaths with DNA testing and genome mapping?

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read.

This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

111,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
116,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."
117,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13200679-dushyant-chaturvedi,4,"What psychological attributes make up a psychopath? Can we measure the degree of such attributes? Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
118,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
119,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
120,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
121,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "
122,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687185-mari,2,"I was going to say this could have been so much better, but really, with the premise presented, I don't know that there was much to salvage. It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "
123,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85949810-rosie-wedge,3,"3.5* rounded downOn the whole, this was an interesting read, and I enjoyed it a lot. Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
124,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."

126,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"

What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies.

And, even then, I didn't think there was much. It wasn't blatantly stated, but something one more had to assume. They can teach us how to keep a cool head in tough situations, about taking rejection well, about putting everything in and not being afraid to lose it. I mean, those are good traits, and I agree with the statement that there are functional psychopaths rather than them all just turning out to be serial killers."

Things we didn’t learn how to do - leverage the decision making power of psychopaths to enhance our lives. The book title is a lie. Too many recaps on research studies. Interesting things I wish were discussed more - will society decide to weed out psychopaths with DNA testing and genome mapping? Will we use gene therapy to “fix” babies who show psychopathic tendencies? Can criminals claim their psychopathic genes made crime inevitable and receive lesser sentences?"

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read. Huge shout out to my friend Tommy for loaning me his copy of The Wisdom of Psychopaths!This review and more can be found at A Reader's Diary!"
135,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

141,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
146,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."
147,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13200679-dushyant-chaturvedi,4,"What psychological attributes make up a psychopath? Can we measure the degree of such attributes? Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
148,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
149,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
150,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "

It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "

It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "
153,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85949810-rosie-wedge,3,"3.5* rounded downOn the whole, this was an interesting read, and I enjoyed it a lot. Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
154,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."

""...the emergence of neurolaw...the increasingly greater interest the courts are now taking in cutting edge neuroscience. The watershed study was published in 2002, and found that a functional polymorphism in a neurotransmitter metabolizing gene predicts psychopathic behavior in men who were mistreated as children. The gene in question - terms, as mentioned previously, the ""warrior gene"" by the media - controls the production of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), low levels of which had previously been linked with aggressive behavior in mice.""""Boys who are abused or neglected, and who possess a variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, are at an increased risk as they get older of turning into violent psychopaths.""""In 2006, Bradley Waldroup's defense attorney, Wylie Richardson, summoned Professor William Bernet, a forensic psychiatrist from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to the witness stand. Waldroup stood accused of one of the must brutal and heinous crimes in Tennessee's history (he committed a murder and viciously assaulted his estranged wife)."" The defensive went on to argue that the defendent has the variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, and that he was violently beaten by his parents as a child. So who's responsible?"
156,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"

What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies.

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read.

165,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

171,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
176,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."

Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
178,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
179,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
180,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
181,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "
182,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687185-mari,2,"I was going to say this could have been so much better, but really, with the premise presented, I don't know that there was much to salvage. It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "
183,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85949810-rosie-wedge,3,"3.5* rounded downOn the whole, this was an interesting read, and I enjoyed it a lot. Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
184,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."
185,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11245511-bridgid,2,"A bit of a tough read at times, but interesting stuff.In ch. 5 ""Make me a psychopath"", the case of Bradley Waldroup. ""...the emergence of neurolaw...the increasingly greater interest the courts are now taking in cutting edge neuroscience. The watershed study was published in 2002, and found that a functional polymorphism in a neurotransmitter metabolizing gene predicts psychopathic behavior in men who were mistreated as children. The gene in question - terms, as mentioned previously, the ""warrior gene"" by the media - controls the production of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), low levels of which had previously been linked with aggressive behavior in mice.""""Boys who are abused or neglected, and who possess a variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, are at an increased risk as they get older of turning into violent psychopaths.""""In 2006, Bradley Waldroup's defense attorney, Wylie Richardson, summoned Professor William Bernet, a forensic psychiatrist from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to the witness stand. Waldroup stood accused of one of the must brutal and heinous crimes in Tennessee's history (he committed a murder and viciously assaulted his estranged wife)."" The defensive went on to argue that the defendent has the variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, and that he was violently beaten by his parents as a child. So who's responsible?"
186,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"
187,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"Interesting, technical and yet entertaining book that mainly focuses on the functional psychopath. What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies. It may be a bit technical for the average reader at times but definitely fascinating. (Also, permanent addition to my office bookshelf)4.39 / 5"

They can teach us how to keep a cool head in tough situations, about taking rejection well, about putting everything in and not being afraid to lose it.

Interesting things I wish were discussed more - will society decide to weed out psychopaths with DNA testing and genome mapping? Will we use gene therapy to “fix” babies who show psychopathic tendencies? Can criminals claim their psychopathic genes made crime inevitable and receive lesser sentences?"

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read.

195,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

201,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
206,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."
207,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13200679-dushyant-chaturvedi,4,"What psychological attributes make up a psychopath? Can we measure the degree of such attributes? Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
208,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
209,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
210,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
211,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "
212,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687185-mari,2,"I was going to say this could have been so much better, but really, with the premise presented, I don't know that there was much to salvage. It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "
213,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85949810-rosie-wedge,3,"3.5* rounded downOn the whole, this was an interesting read, and I enjoyed it a lot. Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
214,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."

216,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"

What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies.

They can teach us how to keep a cool head in tough situations, about taking rejection well, about putting everything in and not being afraid to lose it. I mean, those are good traits, and I agree with the statement that there are functional psychopaths rather than them all just turning out to be serial killers."

Things we didn’t learn how to do - leverage the decision making power of psychopaths to enhance our lives. The book title is a lie. Too many recaps on research studies. Interesting things I wish were discussed more - will society decide to weed out psychopaths with DNA testing and genome mapping? Will we use gene therapy to “fix” babies who show psychopathic tendencies? Can criminals claim their psychopathic genes made crime inevitable and receive lesser sentences?"

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read. Huge shout out to my friend Tommy for loaning me his copy of The Wisdom of Psychopaths!This review and more can be found at A Reader's Diary!"
225,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

231,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
236,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."
237,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13200679-dushyant-chaturvedi,4,"What psychological attributes make up a psychopath? Can we measure the degree of such attributes? Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
238,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
239,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
240,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
241,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "

It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "
243,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85949810-rosie-wedge,3,"3.5* rounded downOn the whole, this was an interesting read, and I enjoyed it a lot. Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
244,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."

""...the emergence of neurolaw...the increasingly greater interest the courts are now taking in cutting edge neuroscience. The watershed study was published in 2002, and found that a functional polymorphism in a neurotransmitter metabolizing gene predicts psychopathic behavior in men who were mistreated as children. The gene in question - terms, as mentioned previously, the ""warrior gene"" by the media - controls the production of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), low levels of which had previously been linked with aggressive behavior in mice.""""Boys who are abused or neglected, and who possess a variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, are at an increased risk as they get older of turning into violent psychopaths.""""In 2006, Bradley Waldroup's defense attorney, Wylie Richardson, summoned Professor William Bernet, a forensic psychiatrist from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to the witness stand. Waldroup stood accused of one of the must brutal and heinous crimes in Tennessee's history (he committed a murder and viciously assaulted his estranged wife)."" The defensive went on to argue that the defendent has the variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, and that he was violently beaten by his parents as a child. So who's responsible?"
246,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"

What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies.

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read.

255,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

261,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
266,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."
267,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13200679-dushyant-chaturvedi,4,"What psychological attributes make up a psychopath? Can we measure the degree of such attributes? Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
268,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
269,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
270,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
271,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "
272,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687185-mari,2,"I was going to say this could have been so much better, but really, with the premise presented, I don't know that there was much to salvage. It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "
273,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85949810-rosie-wedge,3,"3.5* rounded downOn the whole, this was an interesting read, and I enjoyed it a lot. Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
274,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."
275,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11245511-bridgid,2,"A bit of a tough read at times, but interesting stuff.In ch. 5 ""Make me a psychopath"", the case of Bradley Waldroup. ""...the emergence of neurolaw...the increasingly greater interest the courts are now taking in cutting edge neuroscience. The watershed study was published in 2002, and found that a functional polymorphism in a neurotransmitter metabolizing gene predicts psychopathic behavior in men who were mistreated as children. The gene in question - terms, as mentioned previously, the ""warrior gene"" by the media - controls the production of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), low levels of which had previously been linked with aggressive behavior in mice.""""Boys who are abused or neglected, and who possess a variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, are at an increased risk as they get older of turning into violent psychopaths.""""In 2006, Bradley Waldroup's defense attorney, Wylie Richardson, summoned Professor William Bernet, a forensic psychiatrist from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to the witness stand. Waldroup stood accused of one of the must brutal and heinous crimes in Tennessee's history (he committed a murder and viciously assaulted his estranged wife)."" The defensive went on to argue that the defendent has the variation of the gene that codes for low levels of MAOA, and that he was violently beaten by his parents as a child. So who's responsible?"
276,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"
277,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"Interesting, technical and yet entertaining book that mainly focuses on the functional psychopath. What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies. It may be a bit technical for the average reader at times but definitely fascinating. (Also, permanent addition to my office bookshelf)4.39 / 5"

Interesting things I wish were discussed more - will society decide to weed out psychopaths with DNA testing and genome mapping? Will we use gene therapy to “fix” babies who show psychopathic tendencies? Can criminals claim their psychopathic genes made crime inevitable and receive lesser sentences?"

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read.

285,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

290,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25366602-meribeth,0,fascinating -in small doses
291,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
296,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."
297,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13200679-dushyant-chaturvedi,4,"What psychological attributes make up a psychopath? Can we measure the degree of such attributes? Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
298,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
299,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""
