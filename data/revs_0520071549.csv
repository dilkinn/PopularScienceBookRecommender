I am turned off when I see only formulas and symbols, and little text. It is too laborious for me to look at such pages not knowing what to concentrate on.

His own approach to mathematics was definitely more verbal and less symbol-based."
1,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105482-ari,4,"Stanislaw Ulam was a prominent twentieth-century mathematician, famous for inventing Monte Carlo methods -- and co-inventing the hydrogen bomb. This is not quite an autobiography. It's one part memoir, one part musings on science and mathematics, and one part character sketches and anecdotes. It originally started, not as an autobiography of Ulam, but as a memoir of his friend and colleague, John von Neumann. However, the scope grew, and it's now a long picaresque tour of Ulam's life, times, and contemporaries.Several bits caught my attention. First, his description of childhood, college, and graduate mathematics in inter-war poland. My grandfather grew up in a similar milieu so this held personal resonance. It was emotional reading though -- most of the teachers and colleagues he mentions are tagged with ""murdered by the Germans"" or ""died of hard circumstances in Russian exile in 1944"" and the like. It was a grim time to be a Pole.Ulam was a visiting fellow at Harvard in the United States when the war broke out -- basically a postdoc. And he had his kid brother Adam with him, who was just about to start college. When the war started, the two brothers were cut off from their family and the family money -- and Stanislaw reports how frightened and worried he was making ends meet while getting his brother into a college (Brown). Adam turned out fine, as it happens, and went on to become a prominent Sovietologist.By 1943, Stanislaw Ulam got pulled into the Manhattan Project, and went to work in the theory group at Los Alamos. He spent the rest of his career bouncing between academic jobs and the lab. During a period at the lab, he collaborated with Edward Teller on the development of the ""super."" Credit for the invention is disputed -- Teller claimed at various points that the key ideas were his -- but several observers, notably Bethe, think that Ulam made the primary contributions. In Ulam's account here, he had an idea, knew it was a big important idea, told Teller, and they jointly improved it and it formed the basis of all future bombs. Ulam is coy about technical details though -- you won't learn anything about engineering a hydrogen bomb in this book. As I mentioned, this book originally as about von Neumann, not Ulam. Von Neumann was one of the most interesting figures of the century, and Ulam was one of the few people who thought of him as a friend and an equal, not a demigod or a enfant terrible. Ulam's describes Johnny (as he calls him) as exceedingly quick and clever, but not so imaginative or bold as others -- and perhaps with a chip on his shoulder about doing applied math and quasi-math rather than many deep fundamental new mathematical discoveries. The best of the stories is that one day, von Neumann walked into Ulam's office at Princeton to discuss a math problem and said ""the goyim have proved the following theorem"" -- with the implication being that ""we jews should be able to prove a stronger one."" Ulam repeated the joke, and apparently Banach (a ""pure goy"") thought it was hilarious.Ulam has a long description of the Oppenheimer affair (and like the other scientists, felt that Oppenheimer had been treated shabbily.) He does repeat with endorsement Johnny's comment about Oppenheimer's moral feelings: ""Some people profess guilt to claim credit for the sin.""The other favorite story of mine is as follows. After the war, Ulam had a very serious case of encephalitis, and was near death and unable to think. Even after his release from the hospital, he was worried he had suffered serious permanent brain damage. Erdos came to visit, and they played chess. Ulam won, but worried that Erdos was going easy on him. They played a second game, Ulam won again, and then Erdos said ""okay, that's enough chess, I'm done for the night"" -- and Ulam felt reassured that his partner had really been trying.Some choice excerpts from the book are available online: http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?w..."

Along the way he wrote countless papers, but is probably best known for discovering the ""Monte Carlo Method"", today much used in statistical analysis."
3,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32775646-nataliya-borys,3,"Прочитала я книгу видатного математика, одного з авторів водневої бомби, польського єврея зі Львова, Станіслава Уляма, «Пригоди математика». Народився у Львові в заможній єврейській сім'ї львівського адвоката Юзефа Уляма, нащадка переселенців з Венеції. Його мати, Ганна Ауербах, народилася в Стрию, невеликому містечку близько 60 миль на південь від Львова, біля Карпатських гір. Її батько був промисловцем, який займався сталлю і був представником заводів в Галичині та Угорщині.Як молодий амбітний математик, звичайно ж, задавав тон у «Шотландській каварні» (Kawiarnia Szkocka), де найбільші польські математики сиділи при каві та коньяку, розв'язуючи задачі й записуючи розв’язки спочатку на дошці столика, а потім у відомому зошиті в клітинку, званому «Шотландською Книгою» (Księgą Szkocką). Після війни Улям переклав її англійською й уславив у всьому світі.Мені дуже хотілось почитати про міжвоєнний Львів, про відоме коло львівських математиків, але на жаль Станіслав Улям дуже мало про це написав. Також він не згадує ні словом про долю своїх батьків, які залишились у Львові під час Голокосту, ні про сам Голокост, ні про своїх друзів євреїв, ні про долю євреїв, ні про свою єврейкість. Ніби все це не відбувалось ніколи в його житті. Так жаль…."

5,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6403898-tibor-stanko,3,"Ulam's life was undeniably fascinating. I'm hesitant to give four stars because the book was at times not an easy read – it often felt like it would benefit from a more thorough editing. That said, the book is still worth reading, especially if you want to know more about the background of the Manhattan project and the birth of computers. Not from the technical point of view though: Ulam uses the technical jargon very sparsely, but what I found interesting is his account of people he has met and worked with throughout the years: Banach, von Neumann, Fermi, Erdos and many others.Ulam prompts the reader to think about some of the brightest minds of the 20th century not merely as geniuses, but as humans, with all their strengths and weaknesses.Then I was introduced to Einstein himself and noticed his rather peculiar English. He would say: ""He is a very good formula,"" pointing at something on the blackboard! (p.71)I have found the philosophical passages of the book (i.e. Random reflections) a bit long, but at the same time containing many valuable thoughts on math, science, and language. It is a truism to say that there is a clarity to French which is not there in other tongues, and I suppose this makes a difference in the mathematical and scientific literature. Thoughts are steered in different ways. In French generalizations come to my mind and stimulate me toward conciseness and simplification. In English one sees the practical sense; German tends to make one go for a depth which is not always there. (p.275)I am turned off when I see only formulas and symbols, and little text. It is too laborious for me to look at such pages not knowing what to concentrate on. I wonder how many other mathematicians really read them in detail and enjoy them. (p.275)"
6,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46303821-egemen,5,"A phenomenal account of the life of Ulam and many other great intellects of his time. His style is captivating, the clarity of delivery is inspiring. Content-wise, a lot can be said about the richness of his experience, the great achievements of his life, the people around him, the tragedies and more... I'll only comment that I was awestruck by the life of a genius, and certainly this has been the closest I have ever come to understanding how great scientists live their lives."

9,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808220-alexander-temerev,5,"It is just me, of course, but I happen to love exactly this type of autobiographical prose, where accurate accounts and amusing stories for nearly all members of the Manhattan Project are given."
10,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"Ulam was born in 1909 in a wealthy assimilated polonophone Jewish family in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary. When he was a child, the city became Lwów, Poland; by the time it became Lviv, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, he was already in the United States. Ulam showed a talent for mathematics in school (I was surprised to read that he learned algebra from a German translation of Euler's Elements of Algebra), and joined the famous prewar Polish school of mathematics: he knew Banach, Steinhaus and Kuratowski. Prewar Poland also had a great school of cryptanalysis, but this was not publicly known until after this book was published. After Ulam got his Ph.D., there were too few open academic positions in Europe, so he went to the United States, teaching and doing research at Princeton, Harvard, and the University of Wisconsin. During the war Ulam worked at Los Alamos, then taught at the University of Southern California, and then went back to Los Alamos where he co-invented the (American) hydrogen bomb with Teller and Bethe. Apart from his work in pure mathematics (ergodic theory, measure theory etc.), which I cannot appreciate properly, Ulam co-invented cellular automata with his lifelong friend John von Neumann, started the study of branching processes (originally to model the chain reaction in an atomic bomb, though now it is mostly used in population biology), and invented the Monte Carlo method. Much of the book consists of memories of von Neumann; Ulam introduced von Neumann to his second wife; von Neumann invited Ulam to the United States (if Ulam had gone to the Soviet Union in 1935 instead, or stayed in Lwów, his life would have been very different); Ulam showed von Neumann Lwów and von Neumann showed him Budapest; von Neumann was fond of Jewish jokes (e.g. ""The goyim had proved this theorem:..."") and geeky jokes (the points in a plot don't seem to lie on a straight line - well, at least they lie on a plane). It must have been great to live in an amazing time and to befriend geniuses."
11,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855283-ronald-wise,4,"While the mathematical and scientific specifics of this book would probably be intimidating - if not overwhelming - to most readers, the author relates his life story with plenty of enjoyable and easily understood material regarding his personal and professional relationships with many of the greatest minds of the 20th century. And perhaps most interesting was his willingness to frequently interrupt his own narrative to wonder about the nature of human memory, abstract thinking, scientific talent, and the mathematical mind versus the scientific mind.As for the math and science, I struggled to recall what I had learned in college undergraduate courses and had to use the dictionary a few times to grasp the challenges and breakthroughs he enjoyed describing. The mathematics of sets and series were beyond my abilities of abstract thinking in college, and fortunately, when Ulam started to get into those topics, he tended to stop himself and dismiss the topic as beyond the scope of this book.As with most of the biographies I've read of the brilliant minds that arose in Europe in early 20th century, I was most interested in how, in his youth, he found his avocation, or how it found him. I continue to be amazed at the superb educational opportunities then provided in continental Europe, but more so how quickly that system was destroyed by the Nazi regime and the mass exodus of many of the best minds to the United States.Ulam has many stories to tell about how those Europeans came together on American campuses and en masse at Los Alamos. Some of his stories made me laugh out loud, especially ones involving jokes based on some estoric humor which he gladly explains. I don't know why, but I found the Los Alamos Jewish humor much funnier than the Catskills variety. Beyond the fun and games, this book presents a good summary of the critical points in the development of abstract thinking during his lifetime up to 1976."
12,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4102117-maurizio-codogno,2,"Questa è la seconda autobiografia di un matematico polacco che ho letto ultimamente, dopo quella di Mark Kac (vedi http://xmau.com/notiziole/arch/200812... ). Ulam era a Los Alamos nel progetto Manhattan, ed è stato uno degli sviluppatori della bomba H; insomma non esattamente l'ultimo arrivato. Però il libro non mi è affatto piaciuto. Non è tanto il problema dell'incomprensibilità della matematica che ha fatto, anche se garantisco che gli accenni presenti non danno assolutamente alcun appiglio a chi non sappia già le cose; però quegli accenni si possono tranquillamente saltare. Il guaio maggiore è che c'è un'enorme discontinuità nei temi trattati, e aneddoti francamente inutili sono messi esattamente allo stesso livello di altri punti ben più importanti; anche le considerazioni filosofiche e cognitive che di quando in quando appaiono mi sembrano fuori posto nel libro, forse anche perché la traduzione è piuttosto pesante anche se corretta. In definitiva, un libro non all'altezza di quanto sperassi."
13,0520071549,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,4,"One of the best of the Bomb Generation of physicists' autobiographies, right up there with Wigner's and superior to Teller's. This was the great golden age of quantum physics and development of mathematical methods for physics, two fields Ulam was uniquely poised to exploit. Necessary reading for any nuclear buffs due to Ulam's primary role in thermonuclear development (fission primary sparking radiation-driven ablation of a Li-D (Lithium-Deuteride) secondary is, after all, now known as the Teller-Ulam method), and extraordinarily literate (in that sense so associated with the Hungarian expatriates) to boot. Adventures of a Mathematician is excerpted in  The World Treasury of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, which is a fine collection in and of itself."

Este libro, más que una autobiografía, es una recopilación de recuerdos de su vida, anotados rápidamente en trozos de papel o grabados en cintas, y después entregados a su abnegada esposa que tuvo que hacer una labor de chinos para darle forma de libro. El contenido es fascinante (trata sobre la relación de sus matemáticas con el trabajo de sus compañeros físicos), pero la forma es desastrosa, deshilvanada y sin continuidad."
